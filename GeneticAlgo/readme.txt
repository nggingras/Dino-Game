# Genetic Algorithm Dino Game

This project implements the Dino Game using a pure genetic algorithm approach. The goal is to train the dinosaur to navigate through obstacles by evolving its behavior through generations.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Genetic Algorithm Dino Game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Dino-Game.git
    ```

## How it Works

The Genetic Algorithm Dino Game works by evolving a population of dinosaur individuals over multiple generations. Each individual is represented by a set of genes, which encode its behavior in the game. The genetic algorithm applies selection, crossover, and mutation operations to create new generations of individuals with improved performance.
