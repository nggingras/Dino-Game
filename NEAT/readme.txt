The NEAT algorithm, which stands for NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies, is a method used for evolving artificial neural networks. It is commonly used in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning.0

The NEAT algorithm is known for its ability to evolve neural networks with complex structures by allowing the addition and removal of nodes and connections during the evolutionary process. It starts with a population of simple neural networks and evolves them over generations through processes such as mutation and crossover.

The goal of the NEAT algorithm is to find neural network architectures that can solve specific tasks or problems. By evolving the neural networks over generations, the algorithm can discover optimal or near-optimal solutions to the given problem.
