# NEAT Dino Game - Implementation Fixed

## What was fixed:

### 1. **Critical Bug**: Variable name mismatch in ConnectionGene.mutateWeight()
- **Problem**: Used `weight` instead of `m_weight`
- **Fix**: Corrected variable references

### 2. **Missing Core NEAT Components**
- **Problem**: Only had basic gene classes, no actual algorithm
- **Fix**: Implemented complete NEAT algorithm with:
  - Neural network evaluation (feedforward)
  - Population management
  - Evolutionary operations (selection, crossover, mutation)
  - Elitism (keeping best performers)

### 3. **No AI Integration**
- **Problem**: Dino class was manual-control only
- **Fix**: Added AI decision making with:
  - Sensor inputs (obstacle distance, height, type, dino position)
  - Neural network output interpretation
  - Action execution (jump, duck, run)

### 4. **Unfair Training Environment**
- **Problem**: Each dino had independent obstacles
- **Fix**: Created shared ObstacleManager for fair fitness comparison

### 5. **Processing Compatibility Issues**
- **Problem**: Used Java 8 features not available in Processing
- **Fix**: Replaced lambda expressions with traditional loops, used Processing's random() function

## How to Use:

1. Run the NEAT sketch in Processing
2. Watch the population evolve over generations
3. Red circle highlights the best performing dino
4. Press 'R' to reset the population
5. Console shows generation statistics

## Expected Behavior:

- Generation 1: Dinos will perform poorly, mostly random actions
- Generation 5-10: Some dinos will start learning to jump over obstacles
- Generation 15+: Best dinos should consistently avoid obstacles and achieve high scores

The AI should progressively get better at playing the game through evolutionary learning.

## Technical Implementation:

### Neural Network Structure:
- **Inputs (4)**: Distance to obstacle, obstacle height, obstacle type, dino Y position
- **Outputs (2)**: Jump decision, duck decision
- **Activation**: Hyperbolic tangent (tanh)

### NEAT Algorithm Features:
- Population size: 20 dinos
- Elite selection: Top 10% survive to next generation
- Tournament selection: Size 5
- Crossover rate: 75%
- Mutation rates: Weight (10%), Add connection (5%), Add node (3%)

### Game Integration:
- Shared obstacles for all dinos
- Fitness based on survival time and score
- Real-time visualization of best performer
- Generation-based evolution cycle
